# Race scores are given in addition to all stage results.
# IMPORTANT: The tdf score template seemingly deviates from this template,
# However, the result should be the same. The tdf score template doen't score classifications (gc, kom, points, youth) for the final stage.
# Here we score all stages the same way, thus the race scores are the scores minus the stage classification scores.
